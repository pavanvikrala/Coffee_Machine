# Coffee_Machine

This is a coffee machine program made by OOP principles. It asks the user to choose a drink and insert money. 
If the money is sufficient and it provides the drink. We can check the resources by typing in 'report'.
Once the drink is provided, the money is added to the money bank and we can also turn off the machine by typing "off".
